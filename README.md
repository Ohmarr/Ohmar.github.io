<h3 align=center> This repository contains all of the data needed for my personal website portfolio page.</h3>

<h3 align=center>The website was built with Node.js, node package manager (npm), & the gulp (JavaScript toolkit) streaming build system.  </h3>

<h3 align=center>The Logo in my navbar & the website icon ('favicons') were also created by me, and cannot be copied or reproduced.</h3>
